# typed-event-emitter

This module provides an alternative API than the well known event emitting
interfaces used in the browser (DOM) or node.js. Instead of accepting arbitrary
strings as the event name, this module forces you to register your events in
your class. Consequently, the style of binding and emitting events differs a
little bit, ensuring already at binding time that the events actually exists.


## Usage

Take a look at the following snippet (TypeScript):

~~~TypeScript
import { EventEmitter } from 'typed-event-emitter';

class MyClass extends EventEmitter {
  onValueChanged = this.registerEvent<(newValue: number) => any>();
  
  private _value: number;
  
  constructor(value: number) {
    // initialize EventEmitter
    super();
    
    this._value = value;
  }
  
  get value() {
    return this._value;
  }
  
  set value(value: number) {
    this._value = value;
    this.emit(this.onValueChanged, this._value);
  }
}

let instance = new MyClass();
instance.onValueChanged(newValue => {
  console.log(`Value changed: ${newValue}`);
});

instance.value = 27;
~~~

First the *EventEmitter* is loaded from the module. Next, any class, that shall
emit events, must extend that *EventEmitter*. If your class has its own
constructor, make sure to call `super()`.

Any events, your class could emit, must be registered in the form:

~~~TypeScript
onFooBar = this.registerEvent<callbackType>();
~~~

Where `onFooBar` can be any name (it doesn't need to begin with *on*) and
`callbackType` must be the type of the function the listeners must have. With
this, you can see the signature your function must have when you're about to
bind a listener to that event.

To fire/emit an event (only possible from within your event emitter), you have
to call `this.emit(this.onFooBar, ...)`, where `this.onFooBar` is the event to
emit and `...` any number of parameters, that will be passed to the listeners.
